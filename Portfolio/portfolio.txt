âœ… Step 1: Plan Your Website

Before you start coding, plan the sections of your website.

ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Sections:

Home â€“ Your name, photo, and a short introduction.

About Me â€“ Education, skills, career goal.

Projects â€“ List of mini and major projects with links and descriptions.

Resume â€“ Downloadable PDF or online resume.

Contact â€“ Email, LinkedIn, GitHub, and maybe a contact form.

Step 4: Host It Online for Free (GitHub Pages)
1. Create GitHub Repository

Go to GitHub

Create a repo named like portfolio

2. Push your website files:
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial portfolio"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/portfolio.git
git push -u origin main


3. Enable GitHub Pages

Go to repo Settings â†’ Pages

Choose branch: main and /root

Your site will be live at: 
https://yourusername.github.io/portfolio/


Bonus: Use Free Templates

If you donâ€™t want to design from scratch, use free HTML templates:

HTML5 UP

Start Bootstrap

TemplateMo

Just download a template â†’ replace content â†’ deploy to GitHub Pages.
